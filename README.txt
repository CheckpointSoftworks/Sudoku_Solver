CSE3521 Lab 3 README: Contains compilation info. C++ was used for this lab.
Student: Ian Weber 

I tried to keep the compulation commands SIMPLE this time to avoid error. Both the hillClimber and Genetic algorithms are part of one program. The program asks you to type either h or g and press Enter for which one. It then prompts for an input file.  Enter the input file and press Enter.

Compilation Commands: g++ lab3.cpp
Running Commands: a.out

NOTE: For the genetic algorithm, you may have to re-randomize it quite a few times to reach a solution.
